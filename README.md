## About the Video Course
In this course, you will learn to speed up development with microservices on Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. You will build and deploy your microservice architectures in the cloud. 
Then you will add more advanced Micrometer metrics, create declarative metrics, and develop and test high-performance, reactive, non-blocking applications with Spring Boot.
By the end of this course, you will have the confidence to take on any challenge, build useful applications, and develop high-performance, reactive, non-blocking applicationsâ€”all with Spring Boot 2.x
